# Present-Sir
This app aims at marking the attendance status of a class by just clicking  pictures thus conserving
time and solving problems like proxy that are given by students.

- Click on the markattendence option in order to mark the attendance of the detected person

- In order to check what is the attendance marked just go to the homescreen and check the details in our account option

- Remember the attendance is marked for the whole day so one day will carry one attendance
This project can be further extended to far over the boundaries in order to make the 
india digitalised and not only in classrooms but also in offices and in other departments

## Future Works

Here we have made an android app, in future we can use this in integration with video instead of 
images and then marked the attendance according to it.
